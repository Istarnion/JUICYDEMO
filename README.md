JUICYDEMO
=========

Play it [here!](https://istarnion.github.io/JUICYDEMO/)

A simple demo game to show various "juicy" effects to (hopefully) improve the feel of the game, and to elevate a prototype to something that feels better and more complete.

Greatly inspired by this [2012 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) by Martin Jonasson and Petri Purho.

I originally made this for a workshop with students at Nord Universitet in Levanger, Norway, 15th of March, 2023
